Learning to Adapt Noise (LAN)
Image Denoising via Test-Time Noise Adaptation
📌 1. Project Abstract

Real-world image denoising remains challenging due to highly variable and unpredictable noise distributions present across different imaging devices and conditions. Deep learning denoising models often fail when the test noise distribution differs from the training set. This project implements LAN (Learning to Adapt Noise), a test-time adaptation technique that enhances denoising performance without modifying model weights. LAN learns a small pixel-wise noise offset that, when added to the noisy input, shifts the noise distribution toward what the pretrained denoising network expects. This significantly improves performance on real-world unseen datasets.
We integrate LAN with Restormer, NAFNet, and Neighbor2Neighbor/ZS-N2N, and evaluate SIDD-pretrained models on PolyU and Nam datasets. The method demonstrates improved PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality. LAN is lightweight, computationally inexpensive, and effective for robust real-world denoising.
